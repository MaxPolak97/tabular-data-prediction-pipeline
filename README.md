# Creating a GitHub Repository for Tabular Data Prediction Pipeline with XGBoost and CI/CD
Welcome to the "pipeline-tabular-data-predictions" GitHub repository! In this repository, we'll guide you through creating a simple baseline prediction model for tabular data using the powerful XGBoost library. But that's just the beginning â€“ we'll also set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools using GitHub Actions ðŸ¤– to make model development and experimentation a breeze. Moreover, we'll use Weights and Biases ðŸš€ for model development oversight, allowing you to track and visualize model performance, hyperparameters, and datasets in real-time. With Weights and Biases, you can easily compare and analyze different model iterations, enabling data-driven decisions throughout your predictive modeling journey.
